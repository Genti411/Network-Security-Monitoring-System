# Network Security Monitoring System (NSMS)
A comprehensive monitoring solution that detects and alerts on suspicious network activities using machine learning algorithms.
## Project Overview
This script represents the initial structure of a network security monitoring system that captures traffic, applies machine learning models to detect anomalies, and integrates alerting and logging features.

### Features
- Real-time network traffic capture
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Logging of suspicious activity
- Basic monitoring dashboard with Flask
- Deployment via Docker or AWS EC2
- Test coverage and CI-ready structure

##  Ongoing Enhancements
We are actively working on:
 Integrating advanced threat intelligence feeds (e.g., AbuseIPDB, MISP)
 Improving anomaly detection precision to reduce false positives
 Incorporating semi-supervised learning and adaptive thresholds
 Geolocation and threat severity scoring of flagged IPs
